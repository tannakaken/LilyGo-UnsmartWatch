# Unsmart Watch (Based on LilyGoLib)

## About this Project

This repository contains firmware for a no-nonsense clock app that runs on the LilyGo T-Watch S3. 

This repository is based on [LilyGoLib-PlatformIO](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGoLib-PlatformIO).

The only major change is in main.cpp, and this program was created by Tannakaken <tannakaken@gmail.com> based on samples in original repository.

The original README is available below.

# `1` Overview

* This repository demonstrates how [LilyGoLib](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGoLib) uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)

# `2` Platformio IDE Quick Start

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Search for the `PlatformIO` plugin in the `Visual Studio Code` extension and install it.
3. After the installation is complete, you need to restart `Visual Studio Code`
4. After restarting `Visual Studio Code`, select `File` in the upper left corner of `Visual Studio Code` -> `Open Folder` -> select the `LilyGoLib-PlatformIO` directory
5. Wait for the installation of third-party dependent libraries to complete
6. Click on the `platformio.ini` file, and in the `platformio` column
7. Select the board name you want to use in `default_envs` and uncomment it.
8. The default compiled sketch is [main.cpp](./src/main.cpp) in the src directory. If you need to compile an example in LilyGoLib, uncomment one of the lines src_dir = examples/xxxxx to enable it and make sure only one line is valid.
9. Click the (✔) symbol in the lower left corner to compile
10. Connect the board to the computer USB
11. Click (→) to upload firmware
12. Click (plug symbol) to monitor serial output
